# osrs_stocks
osrs_stocks is a Python GUI tool that allows for quick and easy data collection for "flipping stocks" on the in-game stock market of Old School RuneScape.

## Get Started
The goal of "flipping stocks" is to buy an item which you can then sell back later for a higher price.
You can use gui_transaction_tracker.py to record transactions that you are starting. For example, buying 3,000 units of a given stock for $100 each.
Once you've created your transaction, you can use gui_order_manager.py to manage your open transactions by updating buy/sell prices, adjusting quantities bought/sold, etc.
gui_margin_tracker.py is depricated, but if you just want to check margins on current stocks, you can use this tool to record margin checks.
