# osrs_stocks
osrs_stocks is a Python GUI tool that allows for quick and easy data collection for "flipping stocks" on the in-game stock market of Old School RuneScape. It also has a built-in analytical tool to better advise its users about which stocks to purchase.

## Get Started
The goal of "flipping stocks" is to buy an item which you can then sell back later for a higher price.

You can use gui_transaction_tracker.py to analyze and record your stock market transactions. For example, if you choose a stock that buys for $100 and sells for $103 with a buy limit of 10,000 units, then the built-in analyzer will inform the user that this transaction has an ROI of 3% and a profit margin of $30,000.

Once you've created your transaction, you can use gui_order_manager.py to manage your open transactions by updating buy/sell prices and adjusting the quantities bought/sold while on the live market.
